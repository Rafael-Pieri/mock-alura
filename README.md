## Alura Online Courses - Mock: Automatic Test in Java

### Overview
In object-oriented programming, mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways. 
A programmer typically creates a mock object to test the behavior of some other object.

This repository contains some examples of how to use mocks in automatic tests. Below are listed the topics covered during this course:

#### Simulating Behaviors with Mock Objects
* The problem of depending on other systems
* Mockito framework
* Simulating invocation of a method
* when() and thenReturn() methods

#### Ensuring that methods were invoked
* Simulating methods that return nothing
* Ensuring that a method was invoked
* verify() method

#### Mocks throwing exceptions
* Simulating throw exceptions
* doThrow() method

#### Capturing arguments received by Mock
* Testing content of parameters that are passed to methods
* ArgumentCaptor class

#### Isolating to test
* Difficulty testing code that does a lot
* Good Code Practice
* Separating Responsibilities to Facilitate Testing
